            is a small passion project of mine that is meant to teach people
            the very basics of any language they can think of. The idea is to
            give the briefest of introductions to a language, with simple terms like 'hello',
            'thank you', and so on, along with some fun facts.
            <br><br>
            My motivation for the project came from an excitement around
            language learning, as well as a love for traveling. I thought
            the project would be a nice combination of the two. It was also
            the perfect opportunity to further my skills in web development,
            a field I have always been curious about.
            <br><br>
            Thank you so much for checking it out! I hope you found
            it entertaining and/or useful.
