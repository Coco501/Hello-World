        <h3>Willkommen! ¡Bienvenido! Bienvenue! Huānyíng! Welkom!</h3>
        Hello World is a work in progress project by Joe Vogel that aims to teach curious learners the very basics of any language they choose. I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to be able to further develop the web page. I am hoping that this project becomes a fully functional and polished website by the end of 2025.
